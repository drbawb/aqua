## Build Instructions

Below is a list of instructions that describe how to resolve problems I've run into
while attempting to build this project on various platforms. It's non-exhaustive, and since
the Rust compiler isn't checking this it's probably out of date ;)

## TODO

- load schema straight into DB (w/o migrations)
- diesel windows/gnu
- diesel mac/gnu & linux/gnu instructions

## `.env` file

This program expects configuration to be provided in a .env file that lives in the
working directory where you launch the executable from.

At the moment it needs the following parameters:

- `DATABASE_URL=postgres://<user>[:pw]@<host>[:port]/<db>`

## Disel Setup (General)

0. You will need a working installation of PostgreSQL (for the client libs)
0. You will also need credentials to connect to a working PostgreSQL server
0. `cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features "postgres"`
0. `diesel setup`: this will create the database described by `.env` if it doesn't exist
0. `diesel migration run`: this will apply pending migrations


## Diesel Setup (Windows)

0. rustup to rust 1.15+ MSVC x86_64
0. download postgresql (https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads)
0. add postgres\bin & postgres\lib to your path
0. set PQ_LIB_DIR = postgres\lib
0. cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features "postgres"
0. cargo clean && cargo build
